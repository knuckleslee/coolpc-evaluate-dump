    "voice_knu_ready_movie_first_to_tai_rival": "All right, kid, this is it. Don't think I'll go easy on you. If we're gonna race, it's to win!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_first_to_vec_rival": "Good to see you and the boys all made it this time! Now get ready to race, 'cause I'm not gonna go easy on you!",

    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_cre_rival": "Don't worry, kid. I won't get rough with you. But if you wanna run with us, you've gotta toughen up!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_egg_rival": "I hope your racing isn't as lazy as your tricks, Eggman. I'll beat you, fair and square.",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_egp_rival": "Really? I've torn through a hundred of you. Maybe a thousand. Eh, fine, what's one more on the pile?",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_esp_rival": "You said it! I know I can count on you to put up a fight. Let's go! And don't hold nothin' back!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_jet_rival": "I'm as real as they come! You're just scared of how bad I'm gonna beat you!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_met_rival": "Were those fighting words!? I honestly can't tell, but I bet they were! You're on!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_ome_rival": "Oh yeah? Well, there's only one of you left too! Let's see who's standing by the end of this!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_rou_rival": "I know how to drive! Race, I mean! I even know the distinction between the two! I'll show you!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_sag_rival": "Like father, like daughter, huh? I'm not falling for it! Next time you try to trick me, keep it simple.",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_sha_rival": "Don't worry, I won't hold back. Now let's stop talking and get to racing!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_sil_rival": "Sure thing. We'll start by you watching how I beat you in the race. Haha!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_son_rival": "Big talk, little man. I'll put you in your place!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_sto_rival": "You're on! I've been waiting for the day I can knock you down a peg again!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_tai_rival": "Don't need to. Don't believe me? I'll show you.",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_vec_rival": "Sorry, Vector, but not a chance. What kind of friend would I be if I didn't show you the respect of a proper competition?",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_wav_rival": "I've tangled with your gang before. And frankly? Not impressed. ",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_zav_rival": "Yeah, yeah, yeah. Put up or shut up, ugly!",
    "voice_knu_ready_movie_last_to_zaz_rival": "I'd like nothing better. But I came here to race, so I'll just have to settle for beating you on the track.",

    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_sag_rival": "Don't use me to encourage that madman! I'll beat you today and prove just how hopeless your cause truly is!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_sha_rival": "I've seen and endured more than you can imagine. This race is nothing compared to that, and neither are you!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_son_rival": "Destinies are made to be defied! I won't back down!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_sto_rival": "What are you talking about!? I don't look anything like Sonic or you! Well, maybe a little bit. But that's purely coincidence!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_tai_rival": "You may have experience, but I have the will to overcome all obstacles!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_vec_rival": "That'd be cheating! Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell you. Now queue up at the starting line, and let's have an honest race!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_wav_rival": "Sorry, that's not my area of expertise. I'm just here to race. Show me what the tech of today can do!",
    "voice_sil_ready_movie_last_to_zav_rival": "I won't let your evil go unanswered! This may be a \"friendly race\" for everyone else, but I won't hold back against you!",

    "voice_vec_ready_movie_last_to_esp_rival": "Oh, for pity's sake, it's a race! Dodon Pa just wants research data! Think of it this way: we're helping him with an investigation!",
    "voice_vec_ready_movie_last_to_jet_rival": "What's with the guilty conscience? If you've got nothing to hide, then lay it all out on the track!",
    "voice_vec_ready_movie_last_to_knu_rival": "I know you inside and out, Knux! You're no pushover, but neither am I! Get ready to feel the bitter sting of defeat!",

    "voice_vec_ready_movie_last_to_tai_rival": "The Chaotix Detective Agency is doing fine! Real adults know not to pass up a sponsorship opportunity, that's all!",
    "voice_vec_ready_movie_last_to_wav_rival": "The Chaotix Detective Agency always sees a job through, even racing summons. You'll just have to deal with it!",

    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_rou_rival": "Ah, the cunning Rouge. We've only interacted in passing, but I can't underestimate her!",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_sag_rival": "I have only ever been a victim of circumstance. I will make him pay for his arrogance, starting by taking you away from him!",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_sha_rival": "I imagine for the same reason as you: to test our mettle. But there can only be one victor today.",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_sil_rival": "We have lasted for centuries, and will endure for many more. You are just a footnote in our long and deadly legacy.",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_son_rival": "A bold challenge. I shall relish humbling you upon the race course.",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_sto_rival": "Ah, so you're Jet's fodder. I'll eliminate you, then get to the real competitor.",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_tai_rival": "My, how the weak grow overconfident when facing their superiors. See you at the finish line, boy.",
    "voice_zav_ready_movie_last_to_vec_rival": "You think too highly of yourself. Nevertheless, if you wish to challenge me, I'll happily crush your spirit.",

    "voice_big_ready_movie_last_to_tai_rival": "Why not? All I have to do is get to the end of the track first, right? Sounds simple to me.",
    "voice_big_ready_movie_last_to_vec_rival": "Sorry, but I promised my buddy I'd win it all. Better luck next time!",
    "voice_big_ready_movie_last_to_wav_rival": "Sorry, I don't know too much about physics. Maybe you can teach me after I win?",
    "voice_big_ready_movie_last_to_zav_rival": "We already raced together, did you forget? That's okay. I don't remember you either!",
    "voice_big_ready_movie_last_to_zaz_rival": "Oh? Is he nice? Maybe we can after I win this race.",
    "voice_big_ready_movie_rival": "I was planning on winning, but you can try if you want.",

    "voice_wav_ready_movie_last_to_met_rival": "Now you're an interesting piece of hardware. Once I've trounced you on the track, I'll take you apart and see how you work!",

    "voice_wav_ready_movie_last_to_sag_rival": "I'm happy being the best at what I do. Running the world sounds like a chore. I'm content to win this race!",

    "voice_wav_ready_movie_last_to_sil_rival": "I'm in a whole other league than you, kid. Save yourself the embarrassment and sit this one out, 'kay?",
    "voice_wav_ready_movie_last_to_son_rival": "Oh, ha-ha-ha. Your lame jokes don't change the fact that I'll be racing rings around you.",

    "voice_wav_ready_movie_last_to_tai_rival": "Ha! You're using Donpa Motors tech, so you might be able to compete. Don't come crying to me when I lap you, kid!",
    "voice_wav_ready_movie_last_to_vec_rival": "I doubt you could tell the original from a mod if I showed you. Just accept you've already lost and blame it on whatever you like.",
